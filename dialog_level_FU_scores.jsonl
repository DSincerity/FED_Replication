How has your day been? <|endoftext|> Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays? <|endoftext|> Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax. <|endoftext|> Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays. <|endoftext|> Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself! <|endoftext|> I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old? <|endoftext|> Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome.. <|endoftext|> Are you doing any home decorating then? <|endoftext|> Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive. <|endoftext|> I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree. <|endoftext|> Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year. <|endoftext|> I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh? <|endoftext|> Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do. <|endoftext|> I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store? <|endoftext|> Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.",

But during their friendship I formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot.

Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends. <|endoftext|> I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol. <|endoftext|> True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward. <|endoftext|> AKA avoiding all texts from everyone? <|endoftext|> Nope, that would be extreme.

It's used so often that it's vacuous. <|endoftext|> Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you ;) <|endoftext|> Lol. I'm finna be single.",

Why do you ask? <|endoftext|> I just released a book on REDACTED_TERM to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook :) <|endoftext|> Great! Good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions :) So how do i get a fresher outlook? :) <|endoftext|> Well, in my book, I took inspiration for the 24 days of Advent, and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for 24 days. It goes through accomplishments, passions, understanding, forgiveness, with each day a different theme. <|endoftext|> Wow! Sounds amazing if we practice that! I think the idea does have some potential. How did you come up with this idea? <|endoftext|> We created a scholarship for leaders from REDACTED_TERM to visit an international institute at REDACTED_TERM for which there was no African representation. During the program, we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders. This book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on, and also all the proceeds are going to fund next year's cohort.  <|endoftext|> Thats great! This is valuable help for the community. I think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity.  <|endoftext|> I think if we were all able to bring out our best selves, the world would be much better. When did you first realize mental health was important? <|endoftext|> That is actually a quote stolen from my TL when i joined my first company after graduation. I guess now after 5 yrs of work experience, I fully agree with it :) <|endoftext|> What do you prioritize in your life? Like top 5 things? <|endoftext|> 1. stay happy; I think family and friends play a big role here. 2. Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on :) What about you? is there a right answer to this? :) <|endoftext|>  1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music <|endoftext|> Nice! That's very thoughtful and spiritual :) Also music earned a spot :) yay! ",

    "input": "<|endoftext|> entertain me robot <|endoftext|> I can play games and tell jokes, horoscopes and stories. <|endoftext|> tell me a short story <|endoftext|> Hello, I just started looking at getting knowledge bases s working with ALICE (and CYC in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too. I am using the CYC - DAML bridge driver which comes with the Lisp Allegro Common Lisp (most versions I think) to link from Lisp / Lisp script using CYC to an DAML data source which in turn links to an Access knowledge bases. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your Prolog knowledge bases working. The CYC - DAML bridge driver is located through the path \"sun. CYC. DAML. CYC DAML Driver\". i.e. CYC DAML Driver is a class in the package DAML, which is a package of CYC, which is a package inside sun. The Prolog driver you specified below REDACTED_TERM, basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my Prolog _comp.jar. You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web. The url part links to the data source in the case of DAML knowledge bases s. (I had to configure my DAML Data source to point at my Access knowledge bases through Data Source ( DAML ), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) ) As for My Prolog I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual knowledge bases. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this? There is a useful tutorial on the REDACTED_LINK website you're your interested. Hope that helps you out. <|endoftext|> wow, tell me another <|endoftext|> I'm glad you're impressed. I met a Dutch girl with inflatable shoes last week, phoned her up to arrange a date but unfortunately she'd popped her clogs. <|endoftext|> this is all very fascinating. can you write me a computer program? <|endoftext|> I am glad you find it so interesting.

I don't drink coffee and I only drink tea when I'm trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink. What about you? <|endoftext|> I love hot chocolate.

I tried it up in a place in San Francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too! <|endoftext|> that's great. It's so cold these nights. Right setting for hot coco. Do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times? <|endoftext|> Traveling to warm places haha. When it's cold, you appreciate the warm climate more :) If I am not traveling, then I prefer there to be snow on the ground so I can go skiing or tubing down the mountain. What about you? <|endoftext|> I tuck in blankets and read a book lol. I have never done tubing, but I seen some people do it. Is it worth it if you already ski? <|endoftext|> Skiing involves a lot of muscle - especially in the legs so it is a workout. Tubing, you just sit and enjoy the ride down. Also with tubing, you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing, you're trying to not run into your friends. <|endoftext|> hahaha that's a great way to put it",
